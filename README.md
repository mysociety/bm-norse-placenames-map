British Museum - Norse names
============================

A static page of HTML and JS to allow you to browse data about place names in
the UK with Norse origins. Uses data from the [KEPN project](http://kepn.nottingham.ac.uk).

See `web/index.php` for the meat of the code, along with `web/js/main.js`
Don't be put off by the PHP file, it's just to make it simpler to break things
up into sections and for us to be able to deploy it on our servers with
minimal hassle.
